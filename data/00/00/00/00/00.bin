  |   RIOT - Civil Unrest is the highly anticipated real-time riot          |
  |   simulator that places the player right in the heart of some of the    |
  |   world's most fractious clashes. Campaigns include: Indignados         |
  |   (Spain), Arab Spring (Egypt), Keratea (Greece) and NoTAV (Italy).     |
  |   Seventeen single level scenarios include Rome, Oakland, Paris,        |
  |   London and Ukraine.                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   RIOT - Civil Unrest's creator, Leonard Menchiari, experienced         |
  |   rioting first-hand at the NoTAV protests in Italy. He created the     |
  |   game to tell the stories and express the feelings experienced         |
  |   during these clashes. What triggers the crowd to behave with such     |
  |   anger and aggression? Often outnumbered, what does a police officer   |
  |   feel like during the conflict? RIOT - Civil Unrest presents the       |
  |   player with the opportunity to experience both sides of the fight -   |
  |   a fight in which there really are no winners. Who is right and who    |
  |   is wrong? Experience RIOT - Civil Unrest and draw your own            |
  |   conclusions.                                                          |
